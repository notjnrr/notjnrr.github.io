<p>Hola! My name is Junior Kwadwo Asante, but yall can call me Asante. This is my portfolio website for my WEB1430 class. 
  Iam currently a full-time college student in my fifth semester, pursuing a Computer Science degree at Weber State University. 
  For the past two years, I have been working as an office assistant at the Math Tutoring Center on the Ogden campus.
  This site will be a place to showc all of my work and future JavaScript demonstrations. 
  I am really excited to start this class and I'm ready to share my experiences as I continue to improve and grow as a developer.</p>
